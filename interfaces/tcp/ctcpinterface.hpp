// This is very confusing class as it combines both - client and server.
// Server is an instance of CCapsuleReceiver
// while client is this (inherited from San2::Tcp::CTcpClient)
// this actually uses 2 threads, one for client=sender and
// one for server=receiver

// There are 2 completely separate TCP connections (over RPC connections)
// one only receives (CCapsuleReceiver=TcpServer)
// the other only sends (San2::Tcp::CTcpClient)

// This inputQueue is global as it is reference
// ((outputQueue is per interface))

// Server can only make one single TCP connection (e.g. accept())
// to predefined ip and tcp port. If it does not match than it
// closes connection and waits again for another one.
// It is INTENTIONAL and SHOULD be that way. As one interface connects
// only one neighbour node.

// Both client and server are (i hope) designed as fault-tolerant
// so if the remote and disconnects it should reconnect successfully later
